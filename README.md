# Generating-Random-Quiz-Files
Say you’re a geography teacher with 35 students in your class and you want to give a pop quiz on US state capitals.
You’d like to randomize the order of questions so that each quiz is unique, 
making it impossible for any- one to crib answers from anyone else.

Here is what the program does:
1. Creates 35 different quizzes
2. Creates 50 multiple-choice questions for each quiz, in random order
3. Provides the correct answer and three random wrong answers for each question, in random order
4. Writes the quizzes to 35 text files
5. Writes the answer keys to 35 text files.
